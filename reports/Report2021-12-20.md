# Report

Most of my modeling decisions are in the notebooks and as inline comments.
The Readme gives general instructions on how to create the models and process the data.   
The makefile should take care of everything.  

There are exploratory notebooks that I used to decide on modeling features.  

## Executive Summary
I modeled forward price movements, but the model did not yield significant results.

I then modeled the forward liquidity of the best bid/ask price level using a lasso regression.
The model was largely based on momentum of features and price volatility. 

Overall, the model was not significant, but shows promise as a causal model.

## Notes on Modeling

Based on the existing research I read, it seemed that the most interesting
predictive features would be the **bid/ask spread,
price volatility, liquidity, and supply/demand pressures**.  

For modeling purposes the changes in those features are more appropriate, as
it transforms them into more stationary signals, and thus more appropriate as
predictive targets.

I wanted to create a causal model, not just coincidental.  
Because many of the forces mentioned above are typically autocorrelated and the
causal pathway is not always one-way, this made the modeling task difficult. 

So although I made the predictive model for liquidity, an autoregressive VAR
model may be more appropriate for this task. 

The Lasso model will by its nature illuminate which features are additive
to our predictive model.

**Sampling**  
I chose to use a 10 percent sample of one of the orderbooks for the exploratory
data analysis in each case. I chose this approach to reduce the amount of bias
in the analysis. By limiting the data that I analyzed and used in the model
training and then assessing for predictive power on an unseen dataset, I reduce
the risk of creating a model overfit to a small amount of data.

I also only took one observation for each timestamp. 
So the predictive modeling is for each timestep, not intra timestep.

## Models
From the exploratory data analysis, and my experience in financial time series
modeling, I knew that momentum or autocorrelation would be an important factor
in this modeling. 


### Spread Modeling
It looked like the spread at each price level was virtually invariant - e.g.
the spread between ap0 and bp0 was always appx 5 dollars in the 20190612
dataset. This being the case I decided to pursue a more interesting predictive
feature.

### Price Movement Modeling
A principle feature we would have interest in is future price movement.  
I looked at price movements 5000 steps into the future.

As the steps vary in their time interval, I needed to control for this.
To normalize this feature, we will want to look at the **change in price over a
change in time**.

The theoretical causal model in this case would be forward price movement as a
function of supply/demand pressure, price momentum, and market liquidity. The 
supply/demand pressure is measured here as the quantity of bids less the
quantity of asks (i.e. a positive number is higher demand, a negative number
is higher supply), momentum is price change over a defined period of time,
and liquidity is the spread at each price level.

Unfortunately, lasso regression minimized all of the feature importance to zero,
and returned a constant as the best predictor.

So I moved on to modeling liquidity.

### Liquidity Modeling
The next model is on the future liquidity of the best bid and ask. This would
be `bq0 - aq0`. This also acts as a proxy for the supply/demand pressure at
this price level.

The causal model is forward change in liquidity (bq0 - aq0) as a function of
past changes in liquidity across all levels (`bqx - aqx`), rolling price volatility,
and rolling measures of price momentum. All past windows are equal to the
forward prediction window. The forward and rolling window was 5000 steps in my
analysis.

I added a feature of bid and ask vwap. The motivation was that the bid and ask
price movements are slightly independent; and the vwap is a better measure of
long term price movements and pressures.

Interestingly the most important feature in the initial modeling was the past
change in ;iquidity for price level 0. This would suggest that the liquidity
has a momentum. The next most impotrant features we the bid and ask vwap
momentum, and the price volatility (standard deviation). These too suggest that
liquidity is mainly a function of price momentum and the volatility of that momentum.

Unfortunately, this model did not return significant results; however, it does
provide a useful causal model that can be improved upon.

## Potential Improvements

I would like to combine the models from each day into a voting machine. I think
my sampling method could be improved by taking an agregation from each timestamp
rather than just the first observation.

I did not hypertune the Lasso model parameters (alpha) because the purpose of
the Lasso model is to suss out which features are the most significant. If I
were to choose the Lasso model as a final model, I would spend more time tuning
the hyper parameters.

Incorporating data from other assets would likely improve model predictive
performance, as assets tend to move in clusters. 

Calculating more features of liquidity across all bids and asks would likely
improve model performance as well. This could be the change in total quantity
of bids less total quanity of asks.
